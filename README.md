# A few words about take-home exercises

* ‚è≥  ~ Take-home exercises allow you to work at your own pace. We intentionally structure these to take around 3-6ish hours of time and ask that you limit your investment to no more than the suggested time, however you are free to break this into as many sessions as you wish.

* üõ† ~ It matches the nature of our work. Most of being an engineer on a semi-remote team is self-directed exploration of a problem, followed by period(s) of cyclic work/edit/review, followed by submittal for review and approval by your peers. Async exercises allow you to do the same.

* üëÅ ~ It eliminates the performance anxiety of forced-pairing with someone whom you've just met.

* üß∞ ~ It allows you to use the tools, languages, and frameworks where you are the most productive.

# General Instructions

1. Read the `instructions.md` file in the matching directory. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and ask any clarifying questions by emailing careers@bunkertech.id

2. Create a new **private repository** for your exercise and add the Bunker hiring team members as private collaborators (This is to preserve your anonymity so it's not obvious that you are looking for a new role)
    * [Oon Tong](https://github.com/oonyoontong)
    * [Jarvin](https://github.com/jarvin95)

3. Complete as much of the exercise as you can in 6 hours or less. Unless otherwise specified in the `instructions.md` document, you can use any language, framework, or toolchain you wish, although ideally this would be Typescript (Nodejs), Python, Typescript (ReactJS), and SQL (purely because those are the languages we use to build Welcome and will be the most familiar with)

4.  Be sure to include the following in your submission
    * a `README.md` with the following information
        * **A few screenshots of the finished product**. Show off that work! üì∏
        * A short explanation of what you built
        * How to test/demo/run (if applicable)
            * NOTE: a 'working' exercise is awesome, however it is NOT a hard requirement. We mean it!
        * Any feedback/notes (i.e. if something was hard, confusing, frustrating, etc)
        * Anything else you'd like us to know about your submission
    * a `ROADMAP.md` with what you would add/change if you had more time. Dream big.
    * a super-simple test suite if applicable (even one test is a bonus)
    * Some form of lightweight technical documentation (code comments are fine)

5. When complete email a link to the repository and any special instructions to careers@bunkertech.id

6. Sit back and relax. We'll review your submission and get back to you asap (hopefully within 48 hours) :smiley:
