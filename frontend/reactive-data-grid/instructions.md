# Overview
John Doe wants to start understanding his spending habits better. He wants you to create a datagrid that will allow him to better explore his finances and gain insights on where he could possibly cut down his spending. John Doe has 10,000 transactions he wants to look through.

* How you want to structure this datagrid and what insights you want to share is solely up to you (don't go too crazy), an example:
  * Aggregating transactions by counterparty, when users clicks on a counterparty, show all transactions made by selected counterparty, sorted by transaction size

The main focus will be on whether you are able to meet the exercise requirements and how well you structure your code/react components. 

Aesthetics of the datagrid is not a priority, but you can flex your design skills if you want :) 


## Definition of Done
* Reactive data grid that will allow John to explore and gain insights about said transactions
* Data grid must be able to contain thousands of rows, while still having a smooth and lag-free experience
